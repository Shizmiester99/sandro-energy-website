The laser-welded stainless steel gas compartment (leakage ≤0.05%) and micro-positive pressure (0.07MPa) enhance operational safety and maintenance efficiency. Compliant with State Grid standards, it features a 10,000-cycle breaker lifespan, ≤10 pC partial discharge, and corrosion-resistant construction. Ideal for diverse environments, the non-toxic, non-flammable design offers LSC2-PM operational continuity, reducing lifecycle costs through zero gas recycling.",
